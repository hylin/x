## 📦 Installation

### Using npm or yarn or pnpm or bun

**We recommend using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/) or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) or [bun](https://bun.sh/) to install**, it not only makes development easier, but also allow you to take advantage of the rich ecosystem of Javascript packages and tooling.

<InstallDependencies npm='$ npm install @ant-design/x --save' yarn='$ yarn add @ant-design/x' pnpm='$ pnpm install @ant-design/x --save' bun='$ bun add @ant-design/x'></InstallDependencies>

If you are in a bad network environment, you can try other registries and tools like [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/cnpm).

### Import in Browser

Add `script` and `link` tags in your browser and use the global variable `antd`.

We provide `antdx.js`, `antdx.min.js`, and `antdx.min.js.map` in the `dist` directory of the npm package.

> **We do not recommend using the built files** because they cannot be tree-shaken and will not receive bug fixes for underlying dependencies.

> Note: `antdx.js` and `antdx.min.js` depend on `react`, `react-dom`, `dayjs`, `antd`, `@ant-design/cssinjs`, `@ant-design/icons`, please ensure these files are loaded before using them.

## 🧩 Atomic Components

Based on the RICH interaction paradigm, we provide numerous atomic components for various stages of interaction to help you flexibly build your AI dialogue applications:

- General: `Bubble` - Message bubble, `Conversations` - Conversation management
- Wake-Up: `Welcome` - Welcome messages, `Prompts` - Prompt sets
- Expression: `Sender` - Input box, `Attachment` - Attachments, `Suggestion` - Quick commands
- Confirmation: `ThoughtChain` - Thought chains

Below is an example of using atomic components to create a simple chatbot interface:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import {
  // Message bubble
  Bubble,
  // Input box
  Sender,
} from '@ant-design/x';

const messages = [
  {
    content: 'Hello, Ant Design X!',
    role: 'user',
  },
];

const App = () => (
  <div>
    <Bubble.List items={messages} />
    <Sender />
  </div>
);

export default App;
```

## ⚡️ Connecting to Model Inference Services

With the `useXAgent` runtime tool, we make it easy to connect with model inference services that adhere to OpenAI standards.

Here’s an example of using `useXAgent`:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useXAgent, Sender } from '@ant-design/x';

const App = () => {
  const [agent] = useXAgent({
    // Model inference service URL
    baseURL: 'https://your.api.host',
    // Model name
    model: 'gpt-3.5',
  });

  function chatRequest(text: string) {
    agent.request({
      // Message
      messages: [
        {
          content: text,
          role: 'user',
        },
      ],
      // Enable streaming
      stream: true,
    });
  }

  return <Sender onSubmit={chatRequest} />;
};

export default App;
```

## 🔄 Efficient Management of Data Flows

Using the `useXChat` runtime tool, you can easily manage data flows in AI dialogue applications:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useXChat, useXAgent } from '@ant-design/x';

const App = () => {
  const [agent] = useXAgent({
    // Model inference service URL
    baseURL: 'https://your.api.host',
    // Model name
    model: 'gpt-3.5',
  });

  const {
    // Initiate a chat request
    onRequest,
    // Message list
    messages,
  } = useXChat({ agent });

  return (
    <div>
      <Bubble.List items={messages} />
      <Sender onSubmit={onRequest} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```
